# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
For the module 1 assignment I refactored the code for the webpage to meet accessibility standards. In the index.html file, I replaced div elements with semantic elements such as main, nav, section and aside. For the style.css file, I consolidated classes that had the same attributes. I also renamed the classes to keep them organized.

The refactored webpage can be found here: https://mdelmain.github.io/bootcamp-mod01-challenge/Develop/ 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The list of links in the navigation bar link to each section in the main page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
